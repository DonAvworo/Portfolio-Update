  ## Description:
    Websie update:
    This is an udate to my personal Websie. Though it is still under construction, it is functioning as it would 
    be when completed. I have added a few more pages and a few more links. I have also reorganized the the sections
    of the site. At this time, I am working on the "About Me" page. I am also working on the "Links" page so that
    it will navigate to the correct pages. 

    I have also added a button to the Hire-Me page. This button will take you to my resume. The resume is in PDF
    format. If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, you can download it for free at www.adobe.com. The PDF file 
    is stored in the image folder inside the assets folder.


    Noticable bugs:
    Media query is not working as it should. The site is not responsive to small screen size devices. The UL lists 
    moves to the left of the page when the screen size is reduced.
